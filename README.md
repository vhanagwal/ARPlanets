# ARPlanets
Until recently, Augmented Reality was one of those "futuristic" ideas that were portrayed in science-fiction utopias. But the time has come when building an AR app has become a reality, and you can have one in your pocket. This repository contains a simple app that creates Augmented Reality versions of outer-space planets. This uses Apple's new framework, ARKit.
